Overview
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Check out this fun mini project where I experimented with jQuery animations and interactivity. It's split across two branches, each with its own unique feature set:

Main Branch: Features an animated square and an interactive school schedule table.
Catzel Branch: Brings in a playful animation with a dog!

Features
Main Branch
Animated Square: A simple yet cool jQuery animation where a square moves around the page.
Interactive School Schedule: I added a neat school schedule table that allows you to add tasks and toggle rows. Perfect for keeping track of your day-to-day tasks!

Catzel Branch
Animated Dog: On this branch, I replaced the square with a fun animated dog that interacts with the user. Simple, cute, and totally fun to watch!

Enjoy the project and have fun exploring the animations! ðŸ˜„
